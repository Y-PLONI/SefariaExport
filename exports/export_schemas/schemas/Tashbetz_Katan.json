    "enDesc": "Tashbetz Katan is a 13th-century collection of teachings and practices of the Maharam of Rothenberg. When the Maharam was imprisoned after attempting to flee Germany, his student Rabbi Shimshon ben Tzadok visited him. During these visits, Rabbi Shimshon recorded the Maharam’s legal opinions, personal practices, and Torah insights, adding in his own occasional commentary as well. 13th-century scholar Rabbenu Peretz later added notes to the text, which appear in brackets and begin with the word “mihu” (“however”).",
